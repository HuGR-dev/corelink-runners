## [Unreleased]

- feat(workspace): **WP-R1a — workspace foundation (runner-transfer campaign,
  skeleton half)**. Cargo workspace with one member crate,
  `corelink-runners-contracts` — a placeholder lib (real wire-contract types
  arrive in R1b after the R0 transcription freeze) with a trivial test so the
  gate exercises something from day 1. Toolchain pinned to 1.96.0
  (`rust-toolchain.toml`, copied verbatim from hugit), `deny.toml` with the
  HuGR house policy (crates.io only · multiple-versions deny · no skips — the
  empty workspace needs none), CI + DCO workflows on the self-hosted fleet
  (`[self-hosted, mac, corelink-builder]`, never GitHub-hosted) running the
  full gate: fmt · clippy `--workspace --all-targets --locked -D warnings` ·
  test `--workspace --locked` · `cargo deny check` · `cargo audit --deny
  warnings`. Plan: hugit `docs/plan/2026-06-10-runner-transfer-campaign.md` §3.
